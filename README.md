Added a comment in line 158 regarding the interval between moves. The site bitcoin2048 has a limit on the number of games to play in regards to the moves you make in a certain amount of time as well as the number of games played. 
Set the timer to 1 Sec for now.
Thinking about adding buttons to increase and decrease value from the UI.
